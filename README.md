## AboutMe

Over the course of my undergraduate studies, I have developed a broad range of engineering skills both through curricular and extracurricular programs spanning multiple fields. At university, I have worked on and led multiple projects that demonstrate my abilities. During an industry-led project with Ã–ssur, I contributed to the mechanical design and user application of an upper limb prosthesis. Most recently, I worked with a team to develop an automated endo-robotic solution. During my second year, my work ethic was recognised by my advisor and I was awarded the Open Prize for Biomedical Engineering.

Now, I am studying at Heriot-Watt University, doing a Masters in Robotics with Industrial Application
